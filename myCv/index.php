                                    In my instrumentation subject I designed flow meter to measure flow of water through a pipe which had two coils outside to make electric field. The faster the water flows the more electric field is disturbed and less voltage are measured in the electrodes. I used PIC18F452 to make the meter digital and show flow rate on LCD.
